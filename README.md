A small lightweight framework for IoT applications

### 🎈 Special thanks
To build this framework I have used code inspired by the [Django](https://github.com/django/django) project and also
from [Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant/core) project.

Both projects have a strong code base and lightweight and port on different projects.

### 🖇 Library used

### 📚 Documentation

### 🔧 Installation

### ➿ Variables

- set the ROUNDBOX_COLORS environment variable to specify the palette you want to use. For example,
to specify the light palette under a Unix or OS/X BASH shell, you would run the following at a command prompt:
```bash
export ROUNDBOX_COLORS="light"
```
