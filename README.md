***

A small lightweight framework for IoT applications, with main goal to not reinvent the wheel every time when a small
project for IoT device is needed.

The framework contains all tools necessary to bootstrap and run a command a single time or using linux crontab.

You can create apps as many as you like and use them for your proper necessity, but consider that each app is liake a
small container with logic.
Each app has the possibility to host specific commands that will be available  when running manage.py.

### üéà Special thanks üéà
To build this framework I have used code inspired by the [Django](https://github.com/django/django) project and also
from [Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant/core) project.

Both projects have a strong code base and lightweight and port on different projects.

### üîß Installation

The easy way to install RoundBox framework is with [pip]

```bash
$ pip install roundbox
```

If you want to install RoundBox from GitHub use:

```bash
$ pip install git+https://github.com/soulraven/roundbox.git
```

For more detailed install instructions see how [Install] and configure the framework.

***

### ‚ûø Variables

- set the ROUNDBOX_COLORS environment variable to specify the palette you want to use. For example,
to specify the light palette under a Unix or OS/X BASH shell, you would run the following at a command prompt:

```bash
export ROUNDBOX_COLORS="light"
```
